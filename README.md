This is a basic web application prototype <br>
The website is german<br>
I used next.js, tailwindCSS, shadcn and supabase for this project<br>

You can<br>
-select a date to see a calendar in month- or weekview for that specific date (default is the current date)<br>
-Create appointments that are safed with supabase<br>
-Look at these appointments in Listview <br>
-Filter appointmens (in progress)<br>

The application consists of five interactable elements<br>
-The date picker to select the date and change the visualised month or weekview to the corresponding date<br>
-A toggle group  to change between list-, month- and weekview <br>
-An appointment filter menu that does not filter yet<br>
-Create appointment button menu that creates an appointment with Title, Notes and Date<br>
which is then safed with supabase<br>
-the main view element that either shows a calendar view with month- or weekview  <br>
or shows the appointments safed in the databank with listview, monthview and weekview<br>
